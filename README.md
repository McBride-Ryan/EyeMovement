# EyeMovement
### Description 
A web application that follows the movement via the mouse. Through this DOM application you will see two eyes follow the movement. Simple HTML and CSS gives you the apperance, and JS to carry out the logic. Hope you enjoy! 

### Installation
None.


### Usage
Open it up in the browser and have fun! 

### Support
twitter.com/RYANMcBRlDE

### Roadmap
Ultimately I would love to apply some more event listeners. Perhaps if someone were to use the arrow keys the eyes could adapt.
